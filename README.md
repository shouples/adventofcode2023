# Advent of Code 2023

Getting into the holiday spirit with [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2023) puzzles, this year in Python and Rust*! 🐍🦀☃️🎁

There are three main sections below for each day's puzzle, with two icons/emojis representing parts 1 and 2:

 - the exploration/notebook solution(s) for each part
 - the executable Python for each part (`poetry run ./solutions/day____.py`)
 - the executable Rust for each part (`cargo run --bin ____ --release`)
 
For the non-notebook sections, tests (`pytest` and `cargo nextest`) are be included for any with a ✅ to ensure the solutions work with the example inputs provided in each day of Advent of Code puzzle.

| 7   | ✅✅  | ✅✅  | ✅✅ | I haven't had to deal with rust's `Display` impl for custom `fmt` until now, but it helped debugging quite a bit here; it wasn't as clean/straightforward as python's `__repr__` method, but still useful to play with. |
| 8   | ✅🕒  | ✅🕒  | 🕒🕒 | Initially abandoned part 2, but I think I was on the right track (not brute-forcing) and want to revisit it. |

_*I'm starting with Python each day, and using this year as a way to become generally more comfortable with Rust. Maybe I'll start puzzles in Rust next year!_
